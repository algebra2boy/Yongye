	<p class="mt-1 text-gray-700 text-sm font-mono">
		I took this seminar in Fall 2021, and the course went over a brief
		introduction about K nearest neighbors and training and testing using a sample to perform
		predictive analysis, logistic regression, and the use of the Random Forest to evaluate the
		model. At the end of the course, we were tasked with a final project to analyze a dataset and
		present our findings. The final project was about predicting breast cancer from FNA Using
		Machine, and you can find the report from here:
