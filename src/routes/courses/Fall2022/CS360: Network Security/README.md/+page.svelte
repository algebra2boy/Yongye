	<p class="mt-1 text-gray-700 text-sm font-mono">
		I took this course in Fall 2022. This course was a great introduction to the principles and
		practice of computer and network security. The most takeway from this course was understanding
		the importance of cryptography, privacy, and network security. The course covered cryptography
		like SHA and AES, public key infrastructure, and network security like firewalls, malwares, and
		so on. For the final project, I worked on a research paper on the topic of
		<a href="/pdf/SQLInjection.pdf" class="underline"> SQL Injection</a>, which you can find the report from the link.
