		I took this course in the Spring of 2024. I learned the most were advanced git concepts (cherry
		picking, rebasing, squashing, and merging), software design patterns, and software testing, and
		automated testing using Randoop. The course was project-based and we worked in a team to build a
		software system. We used Notion to document everything, and you can find our offical page of our
		final project, <a
